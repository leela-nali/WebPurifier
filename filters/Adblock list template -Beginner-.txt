[Adblock Plus 2.0]
! Placing "[Adblock Plus 2.0]" on top, is a universal way to tell adblockers that this is an adblock list.

! "Title" is what the list shall be called by the adblock tools when it's been added to them.
! Title:

! "Expires" is how often the adblock tool shall attempt to look for changes in the source list. Must be a number followed by "days" or "hours".
! Expires:

! All comments that are not list entries, shall be prefaced by a ! or a #. This tells the adblocker that this line does not indicate a thing that shall be blocked. This is conventionally used to write remarks, or to explain the purpose of the entry/entries that are below that line.
