! Title: ðŸ”£ Assistant list for WordPress validators and translators
! Version: 14October2020v1-Beta
! Expires: 6 days
! Description: As someone who is a translation validator for WordPress.com and WordPress' phone apps, this list fixes some minor botherances to make the process of going through hundreds of strings and suggestions slightly easier. So now I'm sharing them with the world as well.
! Homepage: https://github.com/DandelionSprout/adfilt/blob/master/Wiki/General-info.md#english

! Increases the size of checkboxes in the translation interface, to make it easier to hit the buttons (Especially convenient for validators going through backlogs and validator reports).
translate.wordpress.com,translate.wordpress.org##.checkbox > input:style(height: 25px !important; width: 25px !important)
translate.wordpress.com,translate.wordpress.org##.checkbox:style(padding: 0 !important)

! On language-specific COM overviews, for instance https://translate.wordpress.com/languages/no/, it removes listings that are above the 85% treshold for when theme translations are shown to end-users.
translate.wordpress.com##tr:has(a[href^="/projects/wpcom/themes/"]):has(.percent-completed:has-text(/^8[5-9]|9[0-9]|100/))

! Makes the ORG translation interface wider
translate.wordpress.org##.gp-content:style(max-width: 1600px !important)
