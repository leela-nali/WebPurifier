! Title: 💐 Anti-'Awful comments' list
! Version: 20May2022v1-Beta
! Expires: 7 days
! Description: This is a somewhat alternate approach to the usual anti-comment-section lists, as this list only removes those comment sections that are filled with exceptionally bad comments.
! Note: Out of sheer massive spite against how some newssites deliberately run userpolls on the most contentious articles and only those articles, this list also targets such userpolls now.
